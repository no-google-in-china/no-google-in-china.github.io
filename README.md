Explaining situation from technical perspective

Of course there is Google China as business entity, and of 2017-2018 it is evern expending its presense. 

However since about 2013 there is no Google cloud servers within China, that already make requests travel over longer distance,
and not as much instant as most are used now.

Next all services are blocked. There is no google.com, any google*.com, android.com, Google Play Android application market. (go lang site)
Absotely all services and products are not available.
